# Tivix - QA Recruitment Task

  
## About
The purpose of this project is to create 3 different test cases on the [Tivix Labs](http://qalab.pl.tivixlabs.com/) site.

The tests are made using **Cypress** with **JavaScript** and **cypress-cucumber-preprocessor** which allows us to experience a behavior similar to that of Cucumber in Cypress. More details [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor).

Project has **ESlint** set with plugins like: **Prettier**, **Cypress** etc. to maintain good practises, keep the code clear and out of errors.
Project also has **husky** üê∂ to lint commits before pushing.
